# What was accomplished yesterday?

The Discord channel was super active, immediately diving into brainstorming and planning ways to make the web app more user friendly and fun. We focused on DDR, adding our own twists and ideas while working with a programming language weâ€™re not familiar with and researching as we go. The repository was set up by all of us and organized by Amina, and the UML diagram was finalized.  

Alex: Created the README template and the requirements.txt file, installed Flask, and started working on the user interface, including a simple login page and a dashboard.  

Hannah: Made progress on the scraper, successfully scraping webpages and generating a CSV file. Also created the JSON file, cleaned.json, in the scraper folder.  

# What is planned for today?

Making the csv file and converting Japanese into English will make it easy for us to utilize and develop the database. Today, the team corrected the repository and planned how it should be completed. Excel file was worked on for our planning and upcoming scrum meetings. pathways are finished with CASE #1 and CASE #2.

More description on CASE #1 and CASE #2 Here: 

CASE #1 Fixing and constructing the repository, inserting the provided templates, and arranging. 
CASE #2 Web scraping translation (from Japanese to English) and csv file production 
CASE #3 Verifying credentials. If they match the records in the database, granted access to navigate the app.

# Are there any blockers?

Yes, there are blockers. The team is still working on the repository and the csv file.
