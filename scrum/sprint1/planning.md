# Sprint Planning

Date/Time: 

Participants: Lala, Hannah, Alex, ...

Goal Statement:  On Tuesday Tuesday 11/12/24 between 14:00 and 15:50, the team met up and had a conversation about the sort of project we'd like to do. During class time there were brief introductions and we put forth a couple possible projects and ended up gravitating towards the current project towards the end of that night. Different project members thought about the parts of the project that they liked and gravitated towards those roles.
