# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: Nov 19, 2024, 12:00 AM - Dec 2, 2024, 8:59 PM  
Participants: Lala, Hannah, Patty, Logan  

## What Went Well

- the team showed excellent adaptability in working around the reduced availability during the Thanksgiving holiday.
- database initialization (init.db.py) was successfully implemented, along with item population.
- significant progress was made on the signup function and various routes within routes.py.
- collaboration and communication improved as team members provided clear instructions (e.g., PostgreSQL setup).
- updated UML diagrams and models ensured alignment with project goals.

## What Could Be Improved

- time management could be optimized, as some tasks were delayed due to holiday schedules.
- more even task distribution is needed to prevent bottlenecks, especially with critical functionalities like database integration.
- progress tracking and updates could be more frequent to avoid any mid-sprint misalignment.
- testing coverage for new functionalities like signup and database operations needs enhancement. 

## Action Items for Next Sprint

implement daily or alternate day progress check ins to identify blockers sooner.
develop and execute test cases for the signup function and database-related operations.
prioritize the integration of frontend, backend, and database to ensure cohesive functionality.
continue updating UML diagrams, ensuring they remain consistent with the evolving codebase.
record step by step instructions for database setup and other key components to simplify onboarding or task handover.
