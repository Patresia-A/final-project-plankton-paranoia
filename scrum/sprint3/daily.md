# What was accomplished yesterday?

Alex: Redesigned the homepage to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing layout, centering the content and ensuring an intuitive menu that updates dynamically after users sign in. The updated homepage allows non-registered users to search DDR songs, while providing clear options to log in or sign up if interested. Alex also reorganized the search functionality, revamped the login page, and completely rebuilt the profile section. Currently, they are working on implementing playlists, including the ability to view and add songs to them.  

Hannah: Plans to implement a CSS framework to enhance the overall website design, making it cleaner and more professional. Hannah also aims to develop a new page where users can view their playlists, providing better functionality and accessibility.  

Team Collaboration:
- The group reviewed the rubric and discussed the next steps to ensure the project aligns with the required criteria. Roles were clarified and better distributed to maximize efficiency.  
- A full-day work session is planned on call tomorrow to finalize the majority of the project by Friday, with additional details and refinements scheduled for Saturday.  

Admin Functionality: Deletion capabilities will be restricted to admins for managing playlists in chart form, ensuring proper control over the data.  

Documentation: Amina aims to complete all documentation tonight, including user stories, case sequences, and diagrams, to ensure the project is well-documented and ready for review.
