## What Went Well

Successfully implemented and tested critical routes, including add_favorite and edit_song.
Enhanced database integration, ensuring proper song, playlist, and favorite handling.
Redesigned the homepage for improved user experience
Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.
Enhanced user authentication and authorization.
Improved code organization and structure.
The planned full-day work session resulted in significant progress across multiple tasks.

## What Could Be Improved

Not all team members rebuilt their databases on time, leading to inconsistencies during testing.
Some tasks were delayed due to unforeseen technical challenges and workload imbalances.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

Enhanced Testing:
Expand white box and black box testing coverage, especially for new routes and database interactions.

Task Distribution:
Define clearer roles and responsibilities for each team member.
Use progress tracking tools to balance workloads effectively.

Technical Improvements:
Optimize the add_favorite route to address data overlap between playlists and favorites.
Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend functionalities.

Communication and Coordination:
Schedule more frequent check ins to identify blockers earlier.
Reinforce the importance of rebuilding the database after schema updates.

Documentation Updates:
Keep UML diagrams and user stories aligned with codebase changes throughout the sprint.
Create onboarding materials for any new or complex functionalities.
